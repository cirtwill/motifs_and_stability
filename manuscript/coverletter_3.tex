\begin{letter}{\bf Prof. Dries Bonte\\
Oikos Editorial Office \\
Lund University \\
Lund, Sweden}


\opening{Dear Prof. Bonte:}

    My co-author and I thank you and the Editorial team for accepting our last (extremely late) revision and for providing further thoughtful feedback.
    We are please to resubmit a further revision of our manuscript, in which we have taken care to address each of the Reviewers' comments (preceded by \textbf{R:}) and are confident that the manuscript is clearer as a result.
    In particular, we have added a series of supplemental tests and reported additional statistical information as per Reviewer 1's requests, clarified the text following Reviewer 2's suggestions, and expanded the discussion in response to Reviewer 3's thought-provoking questions. 
    Once again, thank you for the helpful comments.

    \closing{Best regards,}
