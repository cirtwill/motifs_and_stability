\title{Stable motifs delay species loss in simulated food webs}

% - in intro/discussion, make it clear that this is adding a new layer of meaning to differences/changes in species roles rather than trying to put motifs as the best way to predict extinctions.

% Could try Ecology as a general-purpose option?
% Next Theo Bio, then PeerJ. 
% Reviewers: Jon Borrelli, Benno Simmons, Daniel Stouffer, Tim Poisot, Eva Delmas
% To SI: PCA axes, extinction order correlations
% Main text: permanova shows that roles are important, participation to identify which motifs are most strongly assoc. with stability.
% Kate to work on coverletter, language edits
% Need abstract, ?graphical abstract?, author contributions,  
% Need 3-5 bullet point highlights, submitted as a separate file. 
% No obvious word limits?
% Cover Letter.  The cover letter should explain how the manuscript fits the scope of the journal, and more specifically how it advances the field, while having broad appeal. If the manuscript relates to any previous submission to an ESA journal, that must be explained as well.  Longer submissions those between 30 and 50 manuscript pages) should be accompanied by a detailed justification for the length. There is a required text box for the cover letter.  Uploading a cover letter as an attachment is optional.

% Submitted manuscripts may have been posted to a preprint archive if the papers in the archive are not peer-reviewed, and provided that a link to the published article will be added if the manuscript is accepted by an ESA journal.  Authors should disclose whether such a posting has been made at the time of submission.
