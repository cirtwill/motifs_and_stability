- rewiring method: Start with no rewiring for comparison with Kate's MSc. Maybe also try rewiring based on diet similarity or diet overlap? (Not clear on the difference but Kate can get details on the Giljam one.)
	- probably a whole other project... to do 
- S and C ranges: 50-100, C in steps of 0.05.
- What are all of the parameters, and do we want to change any of them? 
- body-masses: set based on TL? With some randomnesss. Sim. what Kate's doing for another modelling paper. 

- take biomasses from the end of the simulation of equilibrium, before removing a species.


- press: reduce growth rates (not sure how modelled)
- pulse: 1x reduction of biomass (can increase proportion gradually)


- invasion: make food web, before equilibrium set 1 sp to 0, equilibrium, then add back in again. Probably want to play with a range of initial biomasses 


- number of time steps to return to initial biomasses = resilience. 

- maybe we want to run some tests to  see how long extinctions usually take.... would be good if it's faster on Linux. 


- Let's go for the preregistration (at least for one bit...)

	- already set up for simple species removals
	- biomass reduction is very simple extinction, would be a good first round.
