\section*{Abstract} %DIF >  Up to 350 words for Ecology
    Some three-species motifs (unique patterns of interactions between three species) are both more stable when modelled in isolation and over-represented in empirical food webs. This suggests that these motifs may reduce extinction risk for species participating in them, ultimately stabilizing the food web as a whole. 
    We test whether a species' time to extinction following a perturbation is related to its participation in stable and unstable motifs and assess how motif roles covary with a species' degree or trophic level.
    We found that species' motif roles are related to their times to extinction following a disturbance. Specifically, \DIFadd{having a larger proportion of the motif role made up by the omnivory motif was associated with longer times to extinction, even though the omnivory motif is less stable than the others in when modelled in isolation.}
    \DIFdel{participating in many omnivory motifs (whether in absolute terms, as a proportion of the species' role, or relative to other species in the network) was associated with more rapid extinction, even though omnivory has previously been identified as a stable motif. Participating in the other three stable motifs (three-species chain, apparent competition, and direct competition) was associated with longer times to extinction.}
    While motif roles were associated with extinction risk, they also varied strongly with degree and trophic level. This means that these simpler measures of a species' role may be sufficient to roughly predict which species are most vulnerable to disturbance \DIFadd{(though motif roles can be used to refine these predictions)}, but \DIFadd{that studies of species' motif participation can also reasonably comment on vulnerability to extinction. Previous research showed that certain motifs appear more frequently in stable webs; we show that this is at least in part because participating in these motifs provides protection from extinction.}%DIF > %If motif roles are already of interest, however, they can also be used to comment on which species are at greatest risk.
    \DIFdel{the additional information encapsulated in a motif role can further refine predictions of vulnerability. Moreover, where researchers are \emph{a priori} interested in motif roles, our results confirm that these roles can be interpreted with respect to extinction risk.}%If motif roles are already of interest, however, they can also be used to comment on which species are at greatest risk.

\section*{Introduction}
    \DIFaddend 

	The connections between food-web structure and the extinction risk of species within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the food }\DIFaddend web have interested ecologists since at least the 1970's~\citep{May1972}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{After early findings suggested that a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Although }\DIFaddend large, randomly-connected \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{network is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{networks are }\DIFaddend unlikely to retain all species after small perturbations~\citep{Gardner1970,May1972}, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{several }\DIFaddend non-random structures that might stabilize food webs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were quickly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(allowing all species to persist) have been }\DIFaddend identified. These structural features include nestedness~\citep{Allesina2012,Sauve2014}, modularity~\citep{Sauve2014,Thebault2010} and skewed distributions of link strengths~\citep{McCann1998,Gross2009,Rooney2012,Wootton2016}.

	
	Although important, these global-scale properties \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(properties of the network as a whole, see Fig. \ref{motifs}) }\DIFaddend can mask important differences in network structure~\citep{Simmons2019} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and do not provide information about differences between species within the same network~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}. 
	Two networks with the same connectance and similar values of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nestness }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{nestedness }\DIFaddend and modularity may still have quite different meso-scale \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(i.e., more detailed than global-scale) }\DIFaddend arrangements of links. 
	These meso-scale structures, described by frequencies of \emph{motifs} (unique patterns of $n$ interacting species), define the local neighbourhood of a focal species and reflect its direct and close indirect interactions (Fig.~\ref{motifs}).
    \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As three-species motifs are the best studied, particularly with respect to stability~}\citep{Stouffer2007,Borrelli2015,Borrelli2015a,Giling2019b}\DIFadd{, we also focus on this size of motif.
	}\DIFaddend 

	
    In addition to providing species-level information on network structure, there are early indications that some meso-scale structures may tend to stabilize food webs~\citep{Prill2005,Borrelli2015,Monteiro2016}. 
    This possibility is supported by the fact that empirical food webs tend to contain more \emph{three-species chains} and either more \emph{omnivory} (\emph{sensu}~\citealp[]{Thompson2007b}) motifs or more \emph{apparent competition} and \emph{direct competition} motifs than random networks~\citep{Stouffer2007}. 
    These four motifs \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(out of 13 total three-species motifs) }\DIFaddend make up, on average, about 95\% of all three-species motifs in food webs~\citep{Stouffer2010b}. 
    The high frequencies of these four motifs in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{oberserved }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observed }\DIFaddend networks suggest that they may be beneficial to the network containing them \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, or}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or, }\DIFaddend in other words, that more stable motifs appear more frequently in empirical food webs because unstable motifs are more likely to disappear as the species within them go extinct~\citep{Borrelli2015,Borrelli2015a} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or links between species are lost~}\citep{Tylianakis2010}\DIFaddend .

	When modelled in isolation, three species arranged in \emph{three-species chain}, \emph{apparent competition}, \emph{direct competition}, and \emph{omnivory} motifs are more likely to all persist than \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{trios of }\DIFaddend species arranged in other motifs~\citep{Borrelli2015a}.
	By damping perturbations and maintaining more constant populations of the species participating in them, these `stable' motifs may contribute to the stability of the network as a whole~\citep{Borrelli2015a}. 
    The greater chances of maintaining all species in a stable motif could explain the over-representation of these motifs in empirical food webs if species and interactions in less-stable motifs are more likely to be ``pruned'' from empirical communities over time. We expect that stable structures will endure for longer than unstable ones, and so it is not surprising that stable structures should be over-represented in empirical communities~\citep{Borrelli2015}.


	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Testing this hypothesis }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Given these early indications that some motifs are more stable than others, we may also expect that a species' role-- here defined as the frequency with which it participates in different motifs --could affect its probability of extinction following a perturbation.
	Specifically, we expect that species participating more frequently in the stable motifs identified by~}\citet{Borrelli2015a} \DIFadd{are less likely to go extinct than species whose roles are dominated by other motifs.
	While `stability' and `disturbance' are multifaceted concepts }\citep{Donohue2013,Radchuck2019}\DIFadd{, we here focus on a dynamic measure of stability after a permanent disturbance --- the time to extinction after a primary extinction. 
	Testing the hypothesis that participation in stable motifs will decrease a species' likelihood of extinction }\DIFaddend is complicated by the fact that species' motif roles are not independent of other aspects of fine-scale network structure. 
    In particular, a species' degree (number of predators and prey) is likely to strongly affect its \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{motifs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{motif }\DIFaddend role.
    The more interaction partners a species has, the more motifs in can participate in (Fig.~\ref{motifs}).
    This is likely to lead \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the species }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{species with higher degrees }\DIFaddend to participate in a wider variety of motifs as well as participate more frequently in the four common, stable motifs.
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Species }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Likewise, species with different trophic levels tend to have different motif roles~}\citep{Cirtwill2018EcolLett}\DIFadd{.
    As well as these correlations between simple network measures and motif roles, species }\DIFaddend with high in-degrees (more prey) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or lower trophic levels }\DIFaddend are also generally less likely to go extinct\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as are species at lower trophic levels}\DIFdelend ~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}.
    \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Any test for a relationship }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This means that relationships }\DIFaddend between motif roles and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{time to extinction should therefore take degree andtrophic level into account}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{extinction risk could be describing relationships between degree and/or trophic level and both extinction risk and motif roles.
    This possibility should be taken into account when interpreting any such relationship between motif roles and extinction}\DIFaddend .

%DIF <  Stability of biological networks has been related to the frequency of different motifs.
  %DIF <  - Prill2005 transcription networks are more stable if they contain more "structurally stable" motifs (motifs whose structures mean a larger parameter space of signs and strengths is stable) motifs. Most stable motifs were apparent competition, direct competition, chain, omnivory (all fully structurally stable - will return to steady state if perturbed without oscillations), then quite a sharp drop before other motifs inc. two-way motifs and one-way loop. Two-way loop was least stable. Stable motifs are more abundant in biological networks. Three classes: I) acyclic graphs (no two-way links), fully stable; II) graphs with one two-way link; III) more complicated circuits (two-way link plus a loop, two two-way links, one-way loop, etc).
  %DIF <  - Stouffer2007 showed chain, omnivory over-represented but both competitions under-represented compared to random in 10/16 empirical webs, competition over-represented and omnivory under in 6/16. Double-loop also over-represented... important to distinguish between abundance and statistical over-abundance of motifs. Motifs in empirical networks consistent with the niche model and not nested-hierarchy. 
  %DIF <  - Stouffer2010 only relevant for pointer to Stouffer2007
  %DIF <  - Stouffer2010b average 95\% of all motifs are chain, omnivory, apparent and direct competition. In isolation, species in tri-trophic chain most likely to all persist, then omnivory, then apparent competition, the direct competition. More species persist in food webs with many chains and omivory, persistence decreases with more apparent and direct competition.
  %DIF <  - Stouffer2005 empirical connectance ranges 0.026-0.315 (25 to 155 trophic species)
  %DIF <  - Stouffer2012 54 distinct roles across 32 webs, up to 22 roles per web (not related to size of web or taxonomic diversity). 46 roles for intermediate species, remainder are basal/int and int/top. Closely related species have similar roles, species with similar roles have similar benefits to their community (based on how much stability increases/decreases when a single motif is added). *Check SI for more details on benefit analysis.
  %DIF <  - Kondoh2008 Intraguild predation modules can be stable if 1) prey is a superior competitor for the resource or 2) extra-module forces such as additional resources exist that benefit the prey more than the predator. In Caribbean food web, all but two species participate in at least 1 IGP module and three sharks are in \>1000. Intrinsically-stable modules were over-represented. Non-intrinsically stable modules were more likely to have external influences favouring prey. If externally-stablised IGP are stabilised by other IGP, may be vulnerable to perturbations. Expect more external stabilisation from internally-stable IGP. This is exactly what was found.
  %DIF <  - Borrelli2015 Systems may be nonadaptively selected for stability by preferential removal of nonstable systems (e.g., culling interactions that lead to oscillations giving low abundances, )
  %DIF <  - Rip2010 Modules that weaken interactions should stabilize the network, looking at "biparallel motif" as one such option - two chains linked at top and bottom. Tested empirically in microcosms, isolated. Generalist consumer de-synchronised its resources, stabilizing community. 
  %DIF <  - Klaise2017 Disagree that the generalized niche model produces networks with similar motif profiles. Clustered food webs with similar profiles using a "hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithm based on the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r)". Distance between webs is sqrt(2*(1-r)). Distances clustered using UPGMA (average linkage) algorithm. Trophic coherence (propensity of species to consume exclusively at the TL below themselves) tunes motif frequencies between two "families", only one of which is generated by the niche model. Main difference is whether omnivory is strongly over- or under-represented.
  %DIF <  - Baiser2015 Local networks resemble regional ones if all trophic groups are sub-sampled with similar frequencies. Not particularly relevant.
  %DIF <  - Monteiro2016  [Haydon1994, May1972, Sterner1997] show that modules are more stable with fewer interactions, small variance in interaction strengths, self-damping processes. Used Jacobian to identify stability of each 3- and 4-species motif, looked at frequencies in empirical networks. AC, DC, chain, and omnivory were all stable (omnivory could also be unstable). More stable motifs appeared more frequen tly. Same for 4-species motifs (4\% were stable). Omnivory ranging stable-unstable can explain contradictory results for omnivory in other studies.
  %DIF <  - Gross2009 High variability in interaction strengths stabilizes small webs, destabilizes large ones. Stability also enhanced by generalist predators (high TL) and very vulnerable intermediate consumers. Used very large suite of simulated networks. No talk of motifs.
  %DIF <  - Dambrot 2017 Having few loops seems to stabilize networks, but we don't know how they come to be un-loopy. Probably trophic coherence again. Not super relevant.
  %DIF <  - Otto2007 Bioenergetic model to explore body-mass ratios and stability of tri-trophic chains. Only particular ratios are stable. Body mass also correlates with degree (+ with number of prey, - with number of predators)
  %DIF <  - Bascompte2005 Ealier work (McCann1998) emphasizes stabilizing role of omnivory but nobody tested whether omnivory over-represented. Apparent competition and intraguild predation (4-sp, two chains with one middle sp. eating the other) more common than expected, omnivory more variable. 
  %DIF <  - Rooney2012 Existence of fast and slow energy channels is stabilizing because it de-synchronises prey populations. Interactions in slow channels also tend to be weaker. Mostly about size and stability.
  %DIF <  - Smith2015 Technical argument about how to standardize community matrices for calculating eigenvalues. Boring (sorry Gyuri)
  %DIF <  - Allesina2008 Pred-prey networks are more likely to be stable than random ones. Varied off-diagonal C from 0.05 to 0.5 with steps of 0.025, size from 10 to 100 with steps of 5. 1000 webs of each size. Determined stability based on percentage of eigenvalues with negative real parts. Did not allow two-way links. Predator-prey networks are more stable than those where signs of interactions are random. Still stable if +/+ and -/- interactions present but less common than pred/prey. Weak interactions not necessary. Short cycles (self-regulation, predator-prey "cycles") may be key, will have greater influence bc. they are smaller. They believe they're supporting the "stable motifs lead to stable networks" lit.
  %DIF <  - Borrelli2014 Food chains are generally 2-4 levels long. When weighted, usually 3 (Ulanowicz2013). Probably not because of inefficient transfer (productivity not strongly correlated with maxTL). Longer food chains take longer to stabilize following a perturbation. Looking at stability of mini-webs and larger random & niche model ones. Found that quasi sign-stability (a la Allesina2008) decreases with increasing chain length, dropping sharply after 3 for mini-webs to almost 0 for length 6.

Affected species may or may not be the one that goes extinct. Tested how web size and connectance affected resistance (size of disturbance required to cause extinction), how traits of disturbed species affected outcome. Found that smaller, less-connected networks were more resistant, focal extinctions more likely. 59\% of extinctions focal, 24\% of extinctions involve indirect interaction partners, 16\% of extinctions predators of focal species, 1\% of extinctions prey of focal species. Higher degree species were more llikely to cause extinction of predators, prey extinctions came from high S, high C webs with focal species with high degree.

    	\DIFdelbegin \subsection*{\DIFdel{Calculating motifs and species roles}}
%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection*{\DIFadd{Calculating species roles}}
    \DIFaddend 

    
    		We were interested in whether species' roles at equilibrium are related to their response to a perturbation, in this case the removal of another species in the network. We defined each species' role as the number of times it appears in each unique three-species motif, following~\citet{Stouffer2012,Cirtwill2015}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Note that each set of three interacting species forms exactly one motif~}\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}\DIFadd{. Our main }\DIFaddend focus is on how different motifs might affect extinction risk, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we do not consider }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{but we also consider how }\DIFaddend the different positions species may take within a motif \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{could provide extra information on vulnerability to extinction}\DIFaddend . We expect that appearing more frequently in stable motifs (three-species chain, apparent and direct competition, and omnivory) will correlate with lower extinction risk while appearing more frequently in unstable motifs (those containing two- or three-species loops) will be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{related to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{associated with }\DIFaddend higher extinction risk.	Note that cannibalistic links were ignored when calculating motif frequencies within a network and species' roles, although they were included when calculating connectance. As well as these \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`}\DIFaddend raw' motif roles, we calculated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'degree normalized}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`species-normalised}\DIFaddend ' motif roles for each species by dividing the number of appearances in each motif by the total number of times the species appears in any motif (as in~\citet{Cirtwill2015}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{). These 'normalized motifs' should control for differences in species' degrees (numbers of interaction partners}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; this total is expected to strongly correlate with degree}\DIFaddend ). Finally, we also calculated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'network normalized}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{`network-normalised}\DIFaddend ' motif roles, defined as the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{z-score }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$Z$-score }\DIFaddend of the number of times a focal species appears in each motif compared to the number of times all species in the network appear in the focal motif.
    		The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{degree }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{species }\DIFaddend normalisation allows us to test whether trends in stability with motif participation are due to differences in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{species' degrees}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the total number of motifs a species appears in}\DIFaddend , while the network normalisation allows us to test whether trends in stability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with participation in different motifs }\DIFdelend are related to how unusual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{each speciesis within its communitycontext}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a species' motif participation is relative to other species in its community, rather than which specific motifs a species participates in}\DIFaddend .

    	%DIF <  Apart from motif-based measures of species' positions in their communities, we calculated their degrees and short-weighted trophic levels. Degree is simply the number of interaction partners for each species. A species' short-weighted trophic level is the mean of its shortest trophic level an prey-averaged trophic level. The shortest trophic level is calculated based on the length of the shortest food chain between the focal species and any basal resource. Basal resources are assigned a trophic level of one and other species are assigned a shortest trophic level of one plus the trophic level of their prey. Prey-averaged trophic level is calculated based on the set of all shortest food chains between the focal species and any basal resources. The focal species' prey-averaged trophic level is the mean trophic level of its prey plus one. These alternative topological measures will be used to evaluate how strongly species' motif roles are related to their response to perturbation compared to other measures of position within a network. These measures were used to test how consistent motif roles and motif participation are for species which share the same degree or trophic level. [[Need to add this formally once I do it.]]

    \DIFaddend 

    		After identifying species' roles in the equilibrium networks, we perturbed the networks by removing a single species. After this removal, community dynamics were simulated for 50 rounds of 10 time-steps (500 time-steps total). After each round, any species with a biomass below our threshold of 1$\times10^{-5}$ was considered to have gone extinct and its biomass was set to 0. We recorded the biomass of each species after each round, as well as the round in which any additional extinctions occurred. After 500 time-steps, we reset the network to its original state (including all species). We then removed a new species and again simulated community dynamics. We repeated this process until all species had served as the initial removal.
    		We then calculated the mean time to extinction across all removals as an overall measure of each species' vulnerability (\emph{Appendix \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{SQ}%DIFDELCMD < }%%%

    		Species which did not go extinct in a given simulation were assigned an extinction time of 500.

    \DIFadd{We found that times to extinction were tightly correlated across removals}\DIFaddend . 
    This suggests that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the position of a focal species within a network can affect its risk of extinction following a disturbance regardless of where in the network the disturbance is applied. 
    This result also justifies our use of mean times to extinction across removals as a measure of a }\DIFaddend species\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{' time to extinction after a perturbation depends on both participating in more/less of a given motif than other species in the focal network and the extent to which a focal species' role is dominated by different motifs.
    Interpreting the relationships between species roles and persistence is complicated by the relationship between degree and motif participation.
    The count of stable motifs in a species' role tended to increase rapidly with increasing number of interaction partners, indicating that degree may capture similar information about extinctionrisk as more complex measures of species roles}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{' overall risk.

    \DIFadd{Taken together, our results show that motif roles are related to mean times to extinction.
    Species-normalised (frequency) motif roles including participation in different positions explained the most variation in time to extinction.
    As expected, participation in positions in the apparent competition, direct competition, and three-species chain were especially associated with longer times to extinction}\DIFaddend .

		\DIFaddend The stronger correlation of extinction orders in larger, more-connected networks\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as well as the somewhat shorter mean times to extinction in these webs (Fig. S1, }\emph{\DIFadd{Appendix S1}}\DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend may be due to the greater number of short pathways by which an extinction somewhere in the web can affect a focal species. 
		These short pathways are more likely to have strong effects on the population dynamics of species along them than \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend longer indirect pathways in poorly-connected networks~\citep{Jordan2002,Jordan2006}.

        For direct competition, these associations may be due to an underlying association between motif roles and degree. 
        Higher degree was associated with longer persistence time and species-normalised roles explained a large amount of the variation in degree, and the associations between frequencies of positions in the direct competition motif and persistence match their associations with degree.

        \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, we note that several of the motifs associated with longer mean }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For example, higher frequencies of all positions in the omnivory motif were associated with shorter }\DIFaddend times to extinction \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also include two-way links (or a three-species loop).

        Motifs including two-way interactions have been under-studied compared to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{degree.
        This is consistent with~}\citet{Borrelli2015a}\DIFadd{'s finding that omnivory motifs are less likely to be stable than the chain and competition motifs.
        Earlier work has shown that the omnivory can be stable or unstable under different conditions and may or may not increase the overall stability of an entire food web~}\citep{McCann1997,Emmerson2004,Borrelli2015a,Monteiro2016}\DIFadd{.
        Our results suggest that omnivory motifs may not benefit the species within them even if they do tend to benefit the network as a whole.
        This could be related to the distribution of link strengths within a food web.
        In small (3-5 species) model communities and soil food webs, weak interactions only promote stability if omnivory is present~}\citep{Neutel2002,Emmerson2004} \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one-way motifswhich have clearer ecological meanings~}%DIFDELCMD < \citep{Bascompte2005,Cirtwill2015}%%%
\DIFdel{.
        As some of these two-way motifs can have similarly-strong relationships to time to extinction as the four well-studied stable motifs, we suggest that more attention should be paid to these motifs in empirical systems.

        In our terms, if the top species in an omnivory motif is lost, the others will be strongly affected.
        Species participating in many omnivory motifs are unlikely to always occupy the top position and may, therefore, be strongly affected by the loss of other species within the same motif.

\DIFdel{suggest that using a species ' degree-normalised motif role to predict stability is not as simple as adding up the contributions of motifs which are stable in isolation.
        When we instead normalize species' motif roles as $Z$-scores relative to frequencies across all species in the network (network normalisation), over-representation of all four stable motifs was associated with longer times to extinction, as were over-representation of several unstable motifs.
    In this framework, motifs in general had weaker relationships to persistence than when degree normalization is used.
        This may be because stable motifs are the most common ones, such that most species participate in many stable motifs.
    Alternatively, this may be due to different scaling between the two relationships (degree-normalized motif frequencies are bounded between 0 and 1 while network-normalized motif frequencies are not bounded).

	    The papers cited above explicitly aim to control for differences due to the total number of motifs in which a species appears (which depends upon the degrees of the focal species }\emph{\DIFadd{and}} \DIFadd{those of its interaction partners) rather than degree }\emph{\DIFadd{per se}}\DIFadd{.
	    However, this distinction is subtle (hence our use of `species-normalisation' to describe the proportional roles) and future authors should take great care that they are not using the sum of motifs as a substitute for degree as our results show that these quantities are not interchangeable.
        Rather, our results suggest that both motif roles and simpler measures of network structure can provide information about a species' response to disturbance.
        Motifs may be particularly useful when comparing species with similar degrees or trophic levels: the multi-dimensional nature of the motif role allows it to capture information which is lost in single-value measures, and participation in the omnivory motif shows a relationship to extinction risk which cannot be explained based on degree or trophic level.
        While the interpretation of motif roles remains challenging, our results suggest that they are nevertheless a valuable tool and that the omnivory motif in particular may be useful when predicting responses to future disturbances.

        \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our aim with this research is not to suggest that motif roles or participation are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We note that our simulations reflect only body-mass structured vertebrate food webs.
        Testing whether these results hold true for other types of networks (e.g., invertebrate food-webs not structured by body mass) will require alternative simulation approaches; however, the increasing availability of highly-resolved empirical data for interactions among invertebrates~}\citep{Waldner2012} \DIFadd{should allow researchers to create such simulations and test the generality of our results in the near future.
        Different network-building mechanisms are likely to result in networks with different motif frequencies overall.
        This will lead to species roles with different frequencies of each motif.
        Nevertheless, as our four focal motifs are the most common in a variety of empirical networks~}\citep{Stouffer2007} \DIFadd{we expect that they will remain important regardless of the type of food web under investigation.
        }

        
        \DIFadd{We also note that our choice of extinction threshold is, in the absence of }\DIFaddend a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{superior predictor of extinction risk to degree or trophic levels.
        Instead, our goal isto expand the interpretation of motif roles.
        Previous research has shown that species ' motif roles reflect their evolutionary history~}%DIFDELCMD < \citep{Stouffer2012} %%%
\DIFdel{and traits such as foraging habitat and body size~}%DIFDELCMD < \citep{Cirtwill2018EcolLett}%%%
\DIFdel{.Our results demonstrate that species ' roles are also relevant for their population dynamics after a perturbation.
        This gives researchers interested in predicting community responses to extinctions an additional tool to work with and expands the relevance of studies of motif roles}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{best-practice consensus, arbitrary.
        The choice of a lower threshold would permit species to remain extant at lower biomasses and lengthen times to extinction for the species most prone to reach low biomasses.
        This could make it more difficult to detect relationships between motif roles and persistence if persistence times became more similar across species (i.e., if more species persist for the entire simulation run). 
        A lower threshold would therefore likely require longer simulations to detect differences in extinction risk between species.
        A lower extinction threshold might also reduce the impact of degree on persistence time as species would be more likely to retain all of their interaction partners.
        However, as interaction strengths depended upon the abundance of a partner, the effect of retaining a very rare predator prey would be minimal.
        Despite this overall decrease in extinction if we used a longer threshold,  we do not expect that }\emph{\DIFadd{which}} \DIFadd{motifs are associated with persistence would change.
        The species which most rapidly go extinct under our current threshold should also be the first to reach a lower threshold (excepting spurious recoveries of rare species between threshold values), leading to similar associations between motifs and extinction risk}\DIFaddend .

The figure is based on the fixed effects in a regression of persistence against participation in positions in the apparent competition, direct competition, omnivory, three-species chain and motifs, with all positions in the `other' (loop-containing; not shown) motifs grouped, as well as random effects of global network structure and network ID. Top positions have prey but no predators within the motif, bottom positions have predators but no prey within the motif, and middle positions have both prey and predators within the motif. We show the marginal effects of increasing frequencies of each position. As position frequencies must sum to 1, we weighted participation in other motifs by their mean values.}}
